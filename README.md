# FlowSwap - Decentralized Exchange on Flow Blockchain

A production-ready decentralized exchange (DEX) **built on Flow** using Cadence smart contracts and React frontend.

## ðŸš€ Built on Flow

This project is built on the **Flow blockchain** and utilizes:
- **Cadence** smart contracts for on-chain logic
- **Flow Client Library (FCL)** for blockchain interaction
- **Flow testnet** for deployment and testing
- **Flow-compatible wallets** for user authentication

### ðŸ“‹ Deployed Contract Addresses (Flow Testnet)

| Contract | Address | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **FlowDEX** | `0x18f0d1d9cfa52c6d` | Main DEX contract with AMM functionality |
| **TestToken** | `0x18f0d1d9cfa52c6d` | Test token (FLOW demo) |
| **TestToken2** | `0x0ea4b4ea56a1260c` | Test token (USDC demo) |
| **FungibleToken** | `0x9a0766d93b6608b7` | Flow standard fungible token interface |

**ðŸ”— View on Flowscan:**
- [FlowDEX Contract](https://testnet.flowscan.org/account/18f0d1d9cfa52c6d)
- [TestToken Contract](https://testnet.flowscan.org/account/18f0d1d9cfa52c6d)
- [TestToken2 Contract](https://testnet.flowscan.org/account/0ea4b4ea56a1260c)

## Features

- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: Constant product formula for price discovery
- **Liquidity Pools**: Add and remove liquidity from trading pairs
- **Token Swaps**: Swap between different tokens with slippage protection
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface with animations
- **Flow Integration**: Built with Flow Client Library (FCL)

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Cadence)
- `FlowDEX.cdc`: Main DEX contract with liquidity and swap functionality
- `TestToken.cdc`: Test fungible token for development
- `TestToken2.cdc`: Second test token for trading pairs

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Modern React application with TypeScript
- Flow Client Library (FCL) for blockchain interaction
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Zustand for state management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Flow CLI
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/panditdhamdhere/FlowSwap.git
cd FlowSwap
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd web
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Deployment

#### âœ… Deployed to Flow Testnet

The contracts are already deployed to Flow testnet! You can interact with them using the addresses above.

#### Deploy to Flow Mainnet

1. Update `flow.json` with mainnet addresses
2. Ensure your account has sufficient FLOW tokens
3. Deploy:
```bash
flow project deploy --network mainnet
```

#### Manual Deployment (if needed)

To deploy contracts manually to testnet:
```bash
# Deploy TestToken
flow accounts add-contract --network testnet --signer <account> ./cadence/contracts/TestToken.cdc

# Deploy TestToken2  
flow accounts add-contract --network testnet --signer <account> ./cadence/contracts/TestToken2.cdc

# Deploy FlowDEX
flow accounts add-contract --network testnet --signer <account> ./cadence/contracts/FlowDEX.cdc
```

## Configuration

### Flow Configuration (`flow.json`)
- Contract addresses and aliases
- Network endpoints (emulator, testnet, mainnet)
- Account configurations
- Deployment settings

### Frontend Configuration (`web/src/fclConfig.ts`)
- Network selection (emulator/testnet/mainnet)
- Access node endpoints
- Wallet discovery settings

## Contract Details

All contracts are deployed on **Flow testnet** and can be verified using the links above. The contracts implement the Flow blockchain standards and are fully compatible with the Flow ecosystem.

## Smart Contract Details

### FlowDEX Contract
- **addLiquidity**: Add liquidity to the pool
- **getReserveA/getReserveB**: Get current reserves
- **getQuoteAtoB/getQuoteBtoA**: On-chain quote helpers with 0.3% fee
- **swapAForB/swapBForA**: On-chain swaps adjusting reserves (demo, no token vault ops)
- **Events**: LiquidityAdded, Swap

### Security Features
- Input validation with pre-conditions
- Slippage protection
- Reentrancy protection
- Access control

## Frontend Features

### Wallet Integration
